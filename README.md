## Cookieless Google Analytics

On 26 May 2011 EU introduced a law that requires websites to implement a cookie opt-in mechanism, effectively meaning that the consumer must give his or her consent before cookies or any other form of data is stored in their browser [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications#Cookies). This law especially targets 3rd-party tracking cookies, like those of Google Analytics. As a result, many EU websites nowadays are covered in opt-in or "implied consent" banners, popups and all sorts of nightmares.

However, if your Google Analytics use case only requires visitor tracking for statistical purposes, and not individual targeting, there is an easy and elegant solution to not use cookies and get rid of the nasty popups. This cookieless implementation of Google Analytics was created by Marek Foss and is using fingerprinting algorithm created by Valve in [Fingerprintjs](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs).

## What is fingerprinting?

Fingerprinting is a technique, outlined in [the research by Electronic Frontier Foundation][research], of
anonymously identifying a web browser with accuracy of up to 94%. 


A browser is queried for its agent string, screen color depth, language,
installed plugins with supported mime types, timezone offset and other capabilities, 
such as local storage and session storage. Then these values are passed through a hashing function
to produce a fingerprint that gives weak guarantees of uniqueness.

No cookies are stored to identify a browser.

It's worth noting that a mobile share of browsers is much more uniform, so fingerprinting should be used
only as a supplementary identifying mechanism there.

## Implementation

Include the `fingerprint.min.js` somewhere on your page (in the `<head>` section, or before the closing `</body>`):
```
<script src="fingerprint.min.js"></script>
```

Update your Google Analytics (GA) code:
```
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

  ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXX-XX', {
    'storage': 'none',
    'clientId': new Fingerprint().get()
  });
  ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
  ga('send', 'pageview');

</script>
```

In the above code, you need to update it using your Tracking ID `UA-XXXXXXX-XX` from your GA property settings.

So what's going on here? First, we instruct GA to not use cookies, by setting `storage` to `none`. Next, we create a unique visitor fingerprint as the `clientId`. Additionally, we are instructing Google to anonymise visitors IP address using the `anonymizeIp` option. Finally, we send a pageview to GA.
